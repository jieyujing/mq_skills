Welcome to the **"Home" of Antigravity**. This repository provides specialized skill packages for the **Quant Dig (掘金量化)** platform, designed to be seamlessly imported into your IDE via Antigravity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Depending on your workflow, you can install these skills globally or for a specific project.

### 1. Antigravity IDE Integration

According to the Antigravity official guide, there are two primary locations for skill storage:

#### 🏠 Global Installation
Use this if you want these skills available across all your projects.
- **Path**: `~/.gemini/antigravity/skills/`
- **Action**: Copy the `mq_skills` folder into this directory.

#### 📂 Workspace Installation
Use this if you want the skills to be restricted to the current project only.
- **Path**: `./.agent/skills/` (within your project root)
- **Action**: Create the `.agent/skills/` directory if it doesn't exist, and copy the `mq_skills` folder into it.
